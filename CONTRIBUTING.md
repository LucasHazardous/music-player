# Contributing to music-player

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

-   Reporting a bug
-   Discussing the current state of the code
-   Submitting a fix
-   Proposing new features
-   Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests. We use available templates for features/issues. Never submit pull requests to main, submit them to dev or other specified branch.

## Report bugs using Github's issues

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

-   A quick summary and/or background
-   Steps to reproduce
-   What you expected would happen
-   What actually happens
-   Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

-   run pre commit git hook for formatting
-   camelCase for variables' names
-   global variables are placed on top of a file

## How to contribute?

1.  Visit currently open issues
2.  Dicuss/create new issue, then implement fixes/features in your personal fork of this repository
3.  Open a pull request to the **dev** branch
4.  Wait for a review
